Triggers on narrow technical intents like "SVG icon", "SVG logo", "SVG pattern", "SVG animation", "polished SVG finish". GATED — does NOT accept illustration, character, mascot, scene, portrait, avatar, or "draw a cat/dog/person" requests (banned by design-principles/ai-slop-avoid.md item 3). Full trigger list in Trigger conditions section. Use when creating a polished SVG icon, logo, badge, pattern, or data-vis primitive. Trigger with explicit "SVG icon", "SVG logo", or "SVG pattern" phrasing.

# SVG Creator (GATED)

> **Orchestrated by:** `../amw-design-principles/SKILL.md`.
> **GATED — icons / logos / technical SVG / patterns / animations only.**
> Characters, scenes, mascots, portraits, avatars, people, animals, and any "draw me X" illustration request are **forbidden** by `../amw-design-principles/ai-slop-avoid.md` item 3 ("AI-drawn SVG illustrations / mascots / scenes"). If the user asks for any of those, STOP and explain: "design-principles bans AI-drawn character/scene SVG; use a real asset or a placeholder box instead." Do not attempt a "quick one" or a "simplified" version — the ban is absolute.

## Overview

Produces polished technical SVG (icons, logos, badges, patterns, data-vis primitives, SVG animations) via a mandatory render-verify-deliver loop using `bin/amw-svg-render.py`. GATED to geometric/technical SVG only — character illustrations, scenes, mascots, and any "draw me X" requests are absolutely refused. The render-verify loop (`write → render → view PNG → assess → fix → finish`) is non-negotiable: `finish` aborts if `render` was never called.

## Instructions

1. Confirm the request falls within scope (icons, logos, badges, patterns, data-vis primitives, SVG animations) — if it requests a character, scene, mascot, avatar, or "draw me X", stop immediately and cite `ai-slop-avoid.md` item 3; offer a placeholder box instead.
2. Write the SVG source (primitives only: `<rect>`, `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`, `<polygon>`, `<path>`, `<line>`, `<g>`, `<defs>`, `<filter>`, `<animate>`); for icons use 24×24 viewBox, 2px stroke, `fill="none"`, `stroke="currentColor"`.
3. Call `bin/amw-svg-render.py render <file.svg>` to rasterize — this is non-negotiable; `finish` aborts if `render` was never called.
4. View the output PNG (`bin/amw-svg-render.py view <file.png>`) and assess for alignment, legibility at 64px, contrast, and animation correctness.
5. Fix any issues in the SVG source and re-render until the PNG assessment passes.
6. Call `bin/amw-svg-render.py finish <file.svg>` to deliver the final artifact with an optimized copy.

See the `## Mandatory workflow` section below for the authoritative 6-step render-verify-deliver loop.

## Examples

See `examples/README.md` for in-scope examples (icons, logos, patterns, data-vis primitives, animations). Advanced SVG techniques (filter chains, noise texture, gradients) are documented in `references/advanced-techniques.md`.

## Activation

No dedicated slash command — this skill has no matching `/amw-*` shortcut. Invoked by the `design-principles` orchestrator as a Phase B finisher in Main-agent mode when the approved design requires polished technical SVG (icons, logos, patterns, animations). The orchestrator may apply any technique this skill exposes — there is no command-layer restriction on access.


This skill is **autonomous and self-contained** — any agent (the main-agent, a sub-agent, or an external orchestrator) can use it by reading this SKILL.md and its references. The skill's techniques are NOT limited to what matching commands expose.

## Position in flow

**OUTPUT (Phase B).** Technical SVG finisher: turns a narrow geometric brief into a polished self-contained `.svg` composed of SVG primitives, with a mandatory render → view → fix loop driven by `../../bin/amw-svg-render.py`. Downstream receiver of `../amw-diagram-svg/` and `../amw-ascii-to-svg/` when those need higher-fidelity finish (gradients, filters, micro-animation) on an already-structured diagram.

## Scope — what this skill CAN produce

- **Icons** — 24×24 stroke icons, grid-aligned, 2px stroke, `fill="none"`, `stroke="currentColor"`, `stroke-linecap="round"`, `stroke-linejoin="round"`, coordinates in 2–22.
- **Logos and badges** — geometric construction, centered, 2–3-color palettes, gradient fills, tested for legibility at 64px width.
- **Technical diagrams** (polished finish) — for unstyled diagrams start in `../amw-diagram-svg/`; route here only to add gradient fills, subtle shadows, or smooth transitions.
- **SVG patterns** — repeating tiles via `<pattern patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">`; `patternTransform="rotate(45)"` for diagonal variants.
- **Data-visualisation primitives** — geometry computed from the data the user supplied; gradient fills on bars/segments; subtle grid (`#f1f5f9` or design-principles neutral); rounded caps.
- **SVG animations** — CSS transitions + SMIL (`<animate>`, `<animateTransform>`, `<animateMotion>`). Every animated element sets `transform-box: fill-box` and `transform-origin: center`. Every animated SVG wraps moving parts in an `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` guard that disables motion.

## Scope — what this skill CANNOT produce

- **Character illustrations** — people, avatars, mascots, cartoon creatures, stylised portraits.
- **Scene illustrations** — landscapes, interiors, skies, environments, product scenes.
- **Animal illustrations** — cats, dogs, foxes, pandas, dragons, anything with a body plan.
- **Abstract decorative art** — "looks hand-drawn", "organic", "painterly", "mood piece".
- **Anything whose value is "this looks like a human illustrator drew it"** — the model cannot verify those coordinates, and the output is visibly AI-slop per `../amw-design-principles/ai-slop-avoid.md` item 3.
- **Anything that substitutes for a real stock or commissioned illustration** — if the user's brief would normally be fulfilled by an Unsplash photo, a purchased SVG pack, or a hired illustrator, it is not this skill's job.

If the request falls in the CANNOT list, stop. Say so explicitly, cite `ai-slop-avoid.md` item 3, and route the user to one of:

1. A **placeholder box** (gray `<rect>` + size label + `alt` describing what the final asset will show) — then ask the user for real assets.
2. `../amw-design-principles/SKILL.md` for broader design routing.
3. Real stock / commissioned assets outside this plugin.

## Trigger conditions (all narrow, all technical)

- "SVG icon of <subject>", "stroke icon", "24 × 24 icon grid", "icon set"
- "SVG logo / badge", "geometric logo", "wordmark SVG"
- "SVG pattern", "repeating tile pattern", "background pattern"
- "data-vis SVG", "render this chart as SVG", "gradient bars / arcs"
- "SVG animation", "animate this SVG", "SMIL animation", "pulse / spinner / progress SVG"
- "polish this SVG" after a diagram came out of `../amw-diagram-svg/`

Do **not** activate on "design a page", "UI", "landing page", "mockup", "prototype", "illustration", "character", "scene", "avatar", "mascot", "draw a <creature>", "cute cartoon", "emotional", "painterly".

## Mandatory workflow

The source skill treats the render-verify loop as non-negotiable. This plugin keeps that invariant.

```
WRITE SVG → RENDER → VIEW PNG → ASSESS → FIX → RENDER → VIEW → ... → FINISH
```

1. **Write** the SVG to a working file (typically `draft.svg` in the current project).
2. **Render** with `python3 ../../bin/amw-svg-render.py render <draft.svg>` — this writes `svg_preview.png` in the plugin's state dir and increments an iteration counter.
3. **View** the PNG. Look at what the renderer actually produced, not at the XML you wrote.
4. **Assess** — positioning, proportions, gradient stops, filter bleed, text legibility, reduced-motion behaviour for animations.
5. **Fix** the SVG and repeat 2–4 until correct. Typical iteration counts for this skill's scope:
   - Icons, logos, single-pattern tiles: **1–2** iterations.
   - Multi-stop-gradient logos, filtered badges: **2–3** iterations.
   - Data-vis with many series, animated SVGs: **3–5** iterations.
6. **Finish** with `python3 ../../bin/amw-svg-render.py finish <draft.svg> [name.svg]`. `finish` **refuses to deliver** if `render` was never called — the guard is by design. Claude must visually inspect the PNG at least once before shipping.

## Prerequisites

- **runtime_binaries (system):** `python3` (available on all supported platforms).
- **runtime_binaries (installed via `/amw-init`):** `cairosvg` — auto-pip-installed by `bin/amw-svg-render.py` on first call, so users on a freshly-cloned plugin do not need to pre-install.
- **npm_packages / mcp_servers:** none.

## Visual-quality techniques

Apply these inside the SVG while building. Each is expanded in `references/advanced-techniques.md`.

- **Multi-stop gradients (4+ stops).** Two-stop gradients look flat; use 4–8 stops with subtle hue shifts. For radial fills (logo spheres, badge centres) offset the light source with `fx="0.3" fy="0.3"`.
- **Five-zone lighting.** Even on a flat logo, a bright light area + true-color mid-tone + cool-hued form shadow (blue / purple / teal, never black) + subtle reflected-light sliver reads more dimensional than a single tint.
- **Coloured shadows.** Shadow fills are `#1e1b4b` (indigo), `#2d1b4e` (purple), or `#0d3b4f` (teal) — never pure black or grey.
- **Drop-shadow filter.** Wrap `feGaussianBlur` → `feOffset` → `feFlood` → `feComposite` → `feMerge`. Always set `color-interpolation-filters="linearRGB"` on the `<filter>` element so blending stays physically accurate.
- **Noise texture.** `<feTurbulence type="fractalNoise" baseFrequency="0.7">` + `feColorMatrix saturate 0` + `feBlend mode="soft-light"`, applied at 5–15 % opacity, breaks digital perfection on logo plates and pattern backgrounds.
- **Animation timing (for the animations scope only).** Pulses 1.2–1.8 s, spinners 0.8–1.2 s per rotation, progress fills 0.4–0.8 s. Every animated SVG ships with a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { animation: none }` block or equivalent SMIL disable, per accessibility best practice.

## Resources

- `../amw-design-principles/ai-slop-avoid.md` — item 3 is the gating rule. Re-read it if tempted to stretch scope.
- `../amw-design-principles/color-system.md` — use `oklch` tokens when the user supplied them; never raw `#000` / `#fff`.
- `../amw-design-principles/typography-system.md` — any SVG text follows the plugin's type scale.
- `../../bin/amw-svg-render.py` — the render-verify-finish loop; see `render`, `finish`, `status`, `reset` subcommands.
- `../amw-diagram-svg/SKILL.md` — upstream when the request is a freeform node-and-edge diagram.
- `../amw-ascii-to-svg/SKILL.md` — upstream when the input is ASCII that needs SVG finish.
- `references/advanced-techniques.md` — full cookbook: filter chains, `feTurbulence` parameter guide, `feComponentTransfer` color grading, material simulation, pattern / background recipes, animation timing. Note: the cookbook retains character-construction sections from the upstream skill — **those sections are out of scope here**; consult them only if you are debugging a diagram element that happens to share the same filter technique.
- `examples/README.md` — in-scope examples (icons, logos, patterns, data-vis primitives, animations). The previously-archived character examples (`cat-astronaut.svg`, `fox-yoga-static.svg`) that shipped with the upstream skill have been moved out of `examples/` to `docs_dev/examples_archive/svg-creator-characters/` so they no longer read as templates for this GATED skill.

## Non-negotiables

- **Character / scene / mascot / avatar requests: REFUSE.** Route to placeholder box or real asset. Cite `ai-slop-avoid.md` item 3.
- **Render-verify before every delivery.** `finish` aborts if `render` was never called — do not work around the guard.
- **Only SVG primitives.** `<rect>`, `<circle>`, `<ellipse>`, `<polygon>`, `<line>`, `<path>`, `<text>`, `<tspan>`, `<g>`, `<defs>`, `<filter>`, `<linearGradient>`, `<radialGradient>`, `<pattern>`, `<marker>`, `<clipPath>`, `<animate>`, `<animateTransform>`, `<animateMotion>`. No raster embeds, no `<script>`, no external CDN fonts or `<image href="http…">`.
- **Self-contained.** No remote resources. One `<svg>` element, its `<defs>`, and its contents.
- **Valid XML with all tags closed.** The file parses without fixups.
- **Colours follow design-principles tokens when supplied,** otherwise `oklch` defaults. Never raw `#000` or `#fff`.
- **Animated SVGs include reduced-motion fallback.** Non-negotiable; users on `prefers-reduced-motion` must see a still frame.
- **Do not claim broad design vocabulary.** `design-principles` owns "design", "UI", "landing page", "mockup" — execute only when the orchestrator routes here or the request is unambiguously technical SVG.

## Error Handling

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| User asked for a mascot / character / avatar | Scope violation | Refuse, cite `ai-slop-avoid.md` item 3, offer placeholder box + ask for real asset. |
| `finish` refuses to deliver | `render` was never called | Run `../../bin/amw-svg-render.py render <file>` first, view the PNG, then `finish`. |
| Gradient bands visible | 2-stop gradient on a large fill | Rewrite as 4–8 stops with small hue shifts; confirm `color-interpolation="linearRGB"`. |
| Drop-shadow edges look dirty | Missing `color-interpolation-filters="linearRGB"` on `<filter>` | Add the attribute to the `<filter>` element. |
| Animation clips / transforms off-centre | Missing `transform-box: fill-box; transform-origin: center;` | Set both CSS properties on the animated element. |
| Reduced-motion users see flashing | Missing `prefers-reduced-motion` guard | Wrap CSS `@keyframes` in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` or disable SMIL via `begin="indefinite"`. |
| SVG fails to parse | Unclosed tag, stray `&`, missing `xmlns` | Close all tags, escape `&` → `&amp;`, ensure `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"` on the root. |
| Logo illegible at 64 px | Detail density too high for small size | Simplify to 2–3 primitives; test at target size in the render-verify loop. |
| `cairosvg` import failure on first render | Fresh environment, first call | Re-run the command; `bin/amw-svg-render.py` auto-installs `cairosvg` on first use, but a second invocation may be needed on slow networks. |

## Completion checklist

Before reporting a job using this skill as complete, verify every item below. FAIL on any item should trigger a remediation loop; do not deliver partial work.

- Inputs captured verbatim from the user (brief, URL, reference files) — no silent paraphrasing that changes meaning.
- At least one `TECH-*.md` file from `skills/amw-svg-creator/references/` was consulted and is cited in the final report.
- Output passes the skill's own non-negotiables (see the `Non-negotiables` section below if present).
- No AI-slop per `../amw-design-principles/ai-slop-avoid.md` (generic gradients, stock-photo hero, fake testimonials, lorem copy, CTA-hero-features-testimonials template).
- If the skill emits HTML/SVG/ASCII, the output was rendered/validated by the matching tool (`bin/amw-validate-ascii.py`, `bin/amw-html-export.py`, `bin/amw-svg-render.py`, etc.).
- Cross-skill hand-offs documented — if work routed through another skill, that skill's SKILL.md + TECH file are named in the report.
- User-facing filename is descriptive English (`Login Flow.html`, not `output.html`).

## Output

This skill produces TWO kinds of output:

1. **Artifact(s)** — the actual work product (e.g. standalone `.svg` icons, logos, technical primitives). The output path is determined by **project inference**, NOT hardcoded. See [`../amw-design-principles/references/project-output-routing.md`](../amw-design-principles/references/project-output-routing.md) for the full detection rules. Summary of the priority order:
   - User-supplied path (honor verbatim)
   - Framework convention (React/Vite/Next/Astro → `./src/...`; Flutter → `./lib/`; etc.)
   - Existing `./design/<subtype>/` folder if present
   - Generic fallback (`./design/diagrams/` or `./public/` for icons/logos created fresh)
   - Last-resort scratch: `/tmp/amw-svg-creator-<slug>/`

   Every artifact file is listed with its path in the report (next item).

2. **Job-completion report** — a markdown file at:
   `$MAIN_ROOT/reports/webdesigner/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS±HHMM>_<title-slug>_<8-char-hash>.md`

   The report must contain, in order:
   - **Inputs** — what the user provided + any auto-detected context
   - **Method** — which TECH references were consulted, which pipeline steps ran
   - **Artifacts** — bullet list, one per produced file, formatted as:
     `- <artifact-path> — <1-line description> — **How to use:** <usage tip> — **Next steps:** <suggested follow-up>`
   - **Checklist** — each item from the Completion checklist above, with PASS / FAIL / N/A
   - **Deviations** — any step skipped or changed, with rationale

   The `<8-char-hash>` is a short content-addressed hash of the report body (e.g. first 8 chars of SHA-256 of the inputs+artifacts list) for uniqueness.

Resolve `$MAIN_ROOT` via `git worktree list | head -n1 | awk '{print $1}'` (main-repo root, worktree-safe).

**Every artifact MUST be linked from the report.** If an artifact is produced but not listed, the skill run is considered incomplete. The report path is distinct from `reports/audit/` (build-time audit artifacts) — `reports/webdesigner/` is for user-facing job outputs from this plugin.
