## Completion checklist

Before reporting a job using this skill as complete, verify every item below. FAIL on any item should trigger a remediation loop; do not deliver partial work.

- Inputs captured verbatim from the user (brief, URL, reference files) — no silent paraphrasing that changes meaning.
- At least one `TECH-*.md` file from `skills/amw-ascii-diagrams-reference/references/` was consulted and is cited in the final report.
- Output passes the skill's own non-negotiables (see [authoring-cheatsheet](authoring-cheatsheet.md) → Non-negotiables).
- No AI-slop per [ai-slop-avoid](../../amw-design-principles/ai-slop-avoid.md) (generic gradients, stock-photo hero, fake testimonials, lorem copy, CTA-hero-features-testimonials template).
  > [ai-slop-avoid.md] I. Visual style · II. Typography · III. Layout · IV. Content and copy · V. Interaction and motion · VI. Color · Self-check workflow · VII. Content density principle (positive stance) · VIII. Content anti-patterns (T-042) · IX. Anti-AI-cliché visual checklist (T-044) · X. Production-test tells (taste-skill, MIT)
- If the skill emits HTML/SVG/ASCII, the output was rendered/validated by the matching tool (`bin/amw-validate-ascii.py`, `bin/amw-html-export.py`, `bin/amw-svg-render.py`, etc.).
- Cross-skill hand-offs documented — if work routed through another skill, that skill's SKILL.md + TECH file are named in the report.
- User-facing filename is descriptive English (`Login Flow.html`, not `output.html`).

## Output

This skill produces TWO kinds of output:

1. **Artifact(s)** — the actual work product (e.g. validated ASCII `.txt` diagrams matching one of the CHI'24 archetypes). The output path is determined by **project inference**, NOT hardcoded. See [project-output-routing](../../amw-design-principles/references/project-output-routing.md) for the full detection rules. Summary of the priority order:
  > [project-output-routing.md] When to consult this doc · Detection order · Per-artifact-type default subpath · Reconciliation when multiple candidates match · Edge cases · Quick-reference algorithm (pseudo-code) · Cross-references
   - User-supplied path (honor verbatim)
   - Framework convention (React/Vite/Next/Astro → `./src/...`; Flutter → `./lib/`; etc.)
   - Existing `./design/<subtype>/` folder if present
   - Generic fallback (`./design/diagrams/` created fresh)
   - Last-resort scratch: `/tmp/amw-ascii-diagrams-reference-<slug>/`

   Every artifact file is listed with its path in the report (next item).

2. **Job-completion report** — a markdown file at:
   `$MAIN_ROOT/reports/webdesigner/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS±HHMM>_<title-slug>_<8-char-hash>.md`

   The report must contain, in order:
   - **Inputs** — what the user provided + any auto-detected context
   - **Method** — which TECH references were consulted, which pipeline steps ran
   - **Artifacts** — bullet list, one per produced file, formatted as:
     `- <artifact-path> — <1-line description> — **How to use:** <usage tip> — **Next steps:** <suggested follow-up>`
   - **Checklist** — each item from the Completion checklist above, with PASS / FAIL / N/A
   - **Deviations** — any step skipped or changed, with rationale

   The `<8-char-hash>` is a short content-addressed hash of the report body (e.g. first 8 chars of SHA-256 of the inputs+artifacts list) for uniqueness.

Resolve `$MAIN_ROOT` via `git worktree list | head -n1 | awk '{print $1}'` (main-repo root, worktree-safe).

**Every artifact MUST be linked from the report.** If an artifact is produced but not listed, the skill run is considered incomplete. The report path is distinct from `reports/audit/` (build-time audit artifacts) — `reports/webdesigner/` is for user-facing job outputs from this plugin.
